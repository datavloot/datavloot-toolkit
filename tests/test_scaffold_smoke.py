"""
End-to-end: does a fresh project actually build a warehouse?

This is the test that would have caught the pair of bugs the scaffold shipped
with. They were fixed one at a time, and fixing the first without the second
turned a loud failure (a parse error) into a silent one (a run that reports
tables built and writes nothing to disk).

Marked `slow`: it runs dbt deps/parse/run and takes a few minutes.
