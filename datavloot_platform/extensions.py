"""
DuckDB extensions the platform needs, installed before first use.

DuckDB downloads an extension the first time something loads it. Behind a
corporate proxy or offline that download fails -- after hanging for about nine
seconds -- in the middle of whatever needed it: a Crows Nest request, a pipeline
run. Installing during `datavloot new` moves the download to a moment when the
user is at the keyboard and can act on the message. Once installed, LOAD and
INSTALL never touch the network again (verified against an unreachable
repository).

Extensions are installed per user and per DuckDB version, under
~/.duckdb/extensions/v<version>/<platform>/. After a DuckDB upgrade they are
installed again on first use, through ensure_loaded().

duckdb is imported lazily, so the CLI and the fast test tier work without the
optimist extra.
