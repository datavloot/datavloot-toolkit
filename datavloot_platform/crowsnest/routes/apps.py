"""
Apps route — the project's dashboards: Marimo notebooks in the apps/ directory,
served with `marimo run`, so they show their output and not their code.

notebooks/ is where the crew explores (`marimo edit`, routes/notebooks.py);
apps/ is what they hand over to people who look at results. On a laptop one
`marimo run apps` server serves every app, started on first use and kept
running, so switching between apps does not restart anything. Behind a proxy
(the Falcon) the apps are a service of their own and the Crows Nest only links
to it, as it does for Marimo.
