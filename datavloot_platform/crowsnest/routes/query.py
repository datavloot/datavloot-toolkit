"""
SQL query route — executes read-only queries against DuckDB.

Two rules replace what used to be here:

  * what may run is decided by parsing, not by inspecting the first word
  * how many rows come back is decided when fetching, not by editing the SQL

The old version matched `sql.split()[0].upper()` against a set of forbidden
keywords, which a leading comment, a leading paren, or anything after a semicolon
walks straight past -- and it never saw `COPY ... TO`, which writes files. It also
appended `LIMIT n` to the query text when the string "LIMIT" did not appear
anywhere in it, so `select 'LIMIT'` returned uncapped and a trailing semicolon
produced `select 1; LIMIT 1000`, a syntax error for anyone who types SQL normally.

The filesystem itself is closed off one level down, in db.py.

Write access (CROWSNEST_SQL_WRITE, see config.sql_write_enabled) widens the
statement allowlist to what changes the lake -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE,
DROP, ALTER, MERGE -- and nothing else: COPY, ATTACH, INSTALL, SET and the rest
stay refused, and the db.py sandbox stays on the read-write connection too.
Write access is to the database, not to the machine.
