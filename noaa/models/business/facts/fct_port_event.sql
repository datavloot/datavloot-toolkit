-- Arrival/departure events derived from AIS position broadcasts,
-- enriched with marine weather conditions at the time of each event.
--
-- Detection logic:
--   1. Parse lon/lat out of the geometry string (WKT POINT format).
--   2. Restrict to ports near Guam (lat 12–15, lon 143–146) to keep the
--      cross-join small before computing full Haversine distances.
--   3. For each (vessel, port) pair ordered by time, flag broadcasts within
--      1.5 nautical miles of the port as "at port".
--   4. A state change from NOT-at-port → at-port = arrival.
--      A state change from at-port → NOT-at-port = departure.
--
-- Weather enrichment:
--   5. Join Open-Meteo hourly conditions at the truncated event hour.
--   6. Range-join sea_state_categories on wind speed to resolve sea_state_code
--      (thresholds defined once in the seed; no duplication here).
